# Notetaker Extension
This web application was built as a make-shift todo application in a code editor format. 
It was built as a personal tool, to serve to help how I currently take down things I have to do (as I am strangely unconventional sometimes)
> This is still a work in progress

If you would like to experiment with what there is thus far follow these instructions:
```
// Install packages
npm i

//Start the server
npm run start
```
The server should now be running in localhost:3000

Thanks!
