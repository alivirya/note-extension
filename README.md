# Notetaker Extension
This web application was built as a make-shift todo application in a code editor format. 
It was built as a personal tool, to serve to help how I currently take down things I have to do (as I am strangely unconventional sometimes)
> This is still a work in progress, but if you would like to experiment with things, and seeing what there is thus far, run `yarn start`.

Thanks!
